<H2 id="1.1">1.1. One account per person, per lifetime</H2>

Users are allowed one account per lifetime.
If your account is disabled, contact staff in <a href={props.TG_DISBALE_CHANNEL}>offical Telegram disabled group</a> or [Staff PM](/staffpm.php).
Never make another account, you will be disabled without question.

<H2 id="1.2">1.2. Do not trade, sell, give away, or offer accounts</H2>

If you no longer wish to use your account, send a [Staff PM](/staffpm.php) and request that your account be disabled.

<H2 id="1.3">1.3. Do not share accounts</H2>

Accounts are for personal use only. Granting access to your account in any way (e.g., shared login details, external
programs) is prohibited. [Invite](/wiki.php?action=article&name=invite) friends or direct them to our <a href={props.TG_GROUP}>official Telegram group</a>.

<H2 id="1.4">1.4. Do not let your account become inactive</H2>

You agree to log into the site regularly in order to keep your account in good standing. Failure to do so will result in
your account being disabled. See [Account Inactivity](/wiki.php?action=article&id=11) for more information.

<H2 id="2.1">2.1. Do not invite bad users</H2>

You are responsible for your invitees. You will not be punished if your invitees fail to maintain required share ratios,
but invitees who break golden rules will place your invite privileges and account at risk.

<H2 id="2.2">2.2. Do not trade, sell, publicly give away, or publicly offer invites</H2>

Only invite people you know and trust. Do not offer invites via other trackers, forums, social media, or other public
locations. Responding to public invite requests is prohibited. Exception: Staff-designated recruiters may offer invites
in approved locations.

<H2 id="2.3">2.3. Do not request invites or accounts</H2>

You may visit invite forum of {props.SITE_NAME} when you reach Power User and above. Some trackers only allow offical
recruitment, their invites may not be offered or requested on the forums in other trackers. You need to read [Rules on
Section of Requesting Invites] and [Do Not Request Invites List](/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=100)
before you request an invite. You may request invites by messaging users only when they have offered them in the Invites
Forum. Unsolicited invite requests, even by private message, are prohibited.

<H2 id="2.4">2.4. Do not reveal site information in public</H2>

<H2 id="3.1">3.1. Do not engage in ratio manipulation</H2>

<H2 id="3.2">3.2. Do not report incorrect data to the tracker (i.e., cheating)</H2>

testing.

<H2 id="3.4">3.4. Do not modify {props.SITE_NAME} .torrent files</H2>

Embedding non-{props.SITE_NAME} announce URLs in {props.SITE_NAME} .torrents is prohibited. Doing so causes false data

have been loaded into a client.

<H2 id="3.5">3.5. Do not share .torrent files or your passkey</H2>

include private message, Staff PM, and

misrepresenting staff decisions is also prohibited.

<H2 id="4.5">4.5. Do not backseat moderate</H2>

"Backseat moderation" occurs when users police other users. Confronting, provoking, or chastising users suspected of
violating rules&mdash;or users suspected of submitting reports&mdash;is prohibited. Submit a report if you see a rule
violation.

<H2 id="4.6">4.6. Do not request special events</H2>

interpretation is final. If you need clarification on a rule, or if you think a rule should be restated, please send a
[Staff PM](/staffpm.php).
