<Heading1 id="content">Upload Rules</Heading1>

<Heading2 id="introduction">Introduction</Heading2>

The uploading rules below are overwhelmingly long and detailed for a reason. The length is necessary to explain the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each rule is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold text</span> before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the [Index](#Index).

Before you upload anything, if you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions at any of the following points of site user support: [First-Line Support](staff.php), [the Help Forum](forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=16), or [{props.BOT_HELP_CHAN} on IRC](wiki.php?action=article&name=IRC). Send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php) addressed to staff if other support has directed you to a moderator or if support has been unhelpful in your particular case. If you find any dead or broken links in the upload rules, send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php) addressed to staff, and include in your message the upload rule number (e.g. [2.4.3](#2.4.3)) and preferably the correct link to replace the broken one.
