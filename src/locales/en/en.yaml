  The report collage option is for reporting a collage which breaks one of the collage guidelines found on the <a href="rules.php?p=collages">collage rules page</a>.
server.reports.report_collage_guide_2: |-
  Collage rules are an interpreted concept, and it is up to staff to interpret these rules. If you feel like this collage might be a borderline case between allowed and not allowed, feel free to report it, and we will look into it.
server.reports.report_collage_guide_3: |-
  We encourage all users to use this feature whenever possible. This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
server.reports.report_collage_guide_4: |-
  In your report description below, please be specific and include as much information as possible that will help our staff resolve the issue.
server.reports.report_forum_thread_guide_1: |-

server.reports.report_request_guide_2: |-
  We encourage all users to use this feature whenever possible. This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
server.reports.report_request_guide_3: |-
  In your report description below, please be specific and include as much information as possible that will help our staff resolve the issue.

server.reports.report_request_guide_4: |-
  <strong>Do not report requests simply because they are unfillable.</strong> Requests for currently unfillable releases are allowed because the request may become fillable in the future. An example of such a scenario would be a request for a physical media rip of a currently Amazon-only release because a physical media release could occur at some future date. The probability of such a physical release is not relevant.

  Please read upload rule <a href='rules.php?p=upload#2.1' target='_blank'>2.1</a> for title naming. Here are some extra explanation.<br/><br/>
  <strong>Movie title</strong>: The English main title of the movie. Please notice that the title that auto filled may not be a normal one, which is a transliteration of the original language title. At this time, we strongly recommend you to use Standard English title, which can be found on:
  <ul>
      <li>Film poster;</li>
      <li>MDb's "Also known as" Illustration;</li>
      <li>If the torrent is an Encode, the file name may be a standard English title.</li>
  </ul>When you can't find a Standard English title by the ways above, then a transliteration is acceptable. For example, Chinese movie <i>The Wandering Earth</i> should not be named as <i>Liu Lang Di Qiu</i>.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>Chinese title:</strong> Please enter the mainland China title. Titles used in Hong Kong or Taiwan province are not allowed.

server.tools.user_permission_note: |-
  Before using permissions, please understand that it allows you to both add and remove access to specific features. If you think that to add access to a feature, you need to uncheck everything else, <strong>YOU ARE WRONG</strong>. The check boxes on the left, which are grayed out, are the standard permissions granted by their class (and donor/artist status). Any changes you make to the right side will overwrite this. It's not complicated, and if you screw up, click the "Defaults" link at the top. It will reset the user to their respective features granted by class, then you can select or deselect the one or two things you want to change. <strong>DO NOT DESELECT EVERYTHING.</strong> If you need further clarification, ask a developer before using this tool.
